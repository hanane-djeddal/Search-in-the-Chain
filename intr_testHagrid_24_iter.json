It began in 1872 with Charles Taze Russell, but experienced a major schism in 1917 as Joseph Franklin Rutherford began his presidency. Rutherford gave new direction to the movement and renamed the movement \"Jehovah's witnesses\" in 1931. The period from 1925 to 1933 saw many significant changes in doctrine.

(The secularly accepted date for the fall of Jerusalem is within a year of 587 BCE; exiles were taken in various years, with most Jews exiled to Babylon following the siege of Jerusalem of 597 BCE.) They believe that Daniel chapter 4 prophesied a period of 2,520 years starting with 607 BCE and ending at 1914 CE. They equate this period with the \"Gentile Times\" or \"the appointed times of the nations\", a phrase taken from Luke 21:24. They believe that when the Babylonians conquered Jerusalem, the line of kings descended from David was interrupted, and that God's throne was \"trampled on\" from then until Jesus began ruling in October 1914. Witnesses believe their doctrine is confirmed by world events since 1914, including wars, famine, earthquakes and increasing lawlessness, which they see as fulfillment of the \"sign\" of Christ's presence. They believe that their preaching is also part of that sign, citing Matthew 24:14. Witnesses teach that in 1918, Jesus resurrected those of the 144,000 (the \"anointed\") who had already died to heavenly life; since 1918, any \"anointed\" are individually resurrected to heavenly life at the time of their death to serve as kings alongside Christ in his heavenly government.", "Inst may refer to:", "In fields such as semantics, semiotics, and the theory of reference, a distinction is made between a referent and a reference.
